## Basic Canvas Animator
Website Link: https://creative-exercise-chraplak.glitch.me/

I used canvas, using https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/tryit.asp?filename=trycanvas_drawimage and https://a1-chraplak.glitch.me/ as a basis.
For changes, I removed the painting image, changed the dimensions, and added polygons on top of the line drawing animation used in a1.
